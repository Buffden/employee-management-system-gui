   docker build -t employee-management-system-app .
   ```
4. Start the backend server using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 --name employee-management-system-app employee-management-system-app
   ```
5. Verify the backend is running by visiting:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/employees
   ```

### Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

2. Start a PostgreSQL container:
   ```bash
   docker run --name postgres-ems -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
   ```
3. Connect to the database using a client (e.g., pgAdmin) and ensure the schema matches the backend configuration.

### Frontend Setup (Angular)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up the proxy configuration for development to avoid CORS issues:

         "logLevel": "debug",
         "changeOrigin": true,
         "pathRewrite": {
           "^/api": ""
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Update `angular.json`:
     ```json
     "serve": {
       "options": {
         "proxyConfig": "proxy.conf.json"
       }
     }
     ```
4. Start the Angular development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
5. Open the application at:
